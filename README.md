This project is part the object oriented programming section of my course at Command Shift.

My learning objectives are:

Create a simple NPM project

Explain why a complete README is important

Initialize and push a git project

To complete the challenge, I'll need to:

Create a virtual-pet directory from the command line

Initialize an NPM project in that repository

Initialize a git repository within that directory

Install Jest and save it as a dev dependency

Set Jest as the test command for your project

Create a .gitignore file and add node_modules to it

Create a README.md file from the command line

Write a clear README

Add the README.md to the staging area

Commit your changes with a clear message

Push the project to GitHub
